In rocky regions, you can use the climbing gear or the torch. You cannot use neither (you'll likely slip and fall).
In wet regions, you can use the climbing gear or neither tool. You cannot use the torch (if it gets wet, you won't have a light source).
In narrow regions, you can use the torch or neither tool. You cannot use the climbing gear (it's too bulky to fit).

You start at 0,0 (the mouth of the cave) with the torch equipped

Moving to an adjacent region takes one minute

You can change your currently equipped tool or put both away if your new equipment would
be valid for your current region. Switching to using the climbing gear, torch, or neither
always takes seven minutes, regardless of which tools you start with.

Finally, once you reach the target, you need the torch equipped before you can find him in the dark.

SO
state changes, not just movement.
